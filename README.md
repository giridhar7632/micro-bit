Have you ever heard about the popular BBC micro:bit? In this workshop we are going to work with BBC micro:bit and create a basis **Flappy Bird Game** using it.:point_down:

![Final Project]()

Here's the [demo/code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_i6g2xLFeTTfP).

## How to play...

The objective is to direct a flying bird :bird:, which is moving continuously to the right, between sets of obstacles. If the player touches an obstacle, they lose. You can check original Flappy Bird Game [here](https://flappybird.io/).

## Prerequisites

Extremely basic knowledge of any programming language. We are going to use JavaScript to code our micro:bit.

If you don't have the hardware, don't worry we will use stimulator in this workshop. [Makecode's](https://makecode.microbit.org) micro:bit simulator was excellent!

## Getting Started

Micro bit is a tiny piece of hardware with many features. It a pocket size computer which performs what you say. We have to write a computer program and upload it to micro:bit what to do. A micro USB cable is used to transfer the code from PC to micro:bit.

A micro:bit can only do what you tell it to do. You can use different programming languages to write program like [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/), which you can use to code in code blocks or JavaScript. You can also use [Python](https://python.microbit.org/v/2) to program a micro:bit.

On front face, it has 25 LEDs which we will use to display our game.

These are the main parts of a micro:bit.:point_down:

## Setup

Open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and click on :heavy_plus_sign:`New Project`.
