In this workshop we are going to learn about BBC micro:bit and create a **Flappy Bird Game** using it. We are going to build something like this.:point_down:

![Final Project]()

Check out final [Demo/Code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_i6g2xLFeTTfP).

## How to play...

The objective is to direct a flying bird :bird:, which is moving continuously to the right, between sets of obstacles. If the player touches an obstacle, they lose. You can check original Flappy Bird Game [here](https://flappybird.io/).

## Prerequisites

Extremely basic knowledge of any programming language. We are going to use code blocks, which are very easy to use without knowing a programming language.

## Setup

Open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and click on :heavy_plus_symbol:`New Project`.

![Setup]()

You should see something like this.
