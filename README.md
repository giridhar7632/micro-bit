In this workshop we are going to learn about BBC micro:bit and create a **Flappy Bird Game** using it. We are going to build something like this.:point_down:

![Final Project]()

Check out final [Demo/Code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_i6g2xLFeTTfP).

## How to play...

The objective is to direct a flying bird :bird:, which is moving continuously to the right, between sets of obstacles. If the player touches an obstacle, they lose. You can check original Flappy Bird Game [here](https://flappybird.io/).

## Prerequisites

Extremely basic knowledge of any programming language. We are going to use code blocks, which are very easy to use without knowing a programming language.

Using Hardware is recommended. But don't worry if you don't have a micro:bit, we will use stimulator in this workshop.

## micro:bit

Micro bit is a tiny piece of hardware with many features. It a pocket size computer which performs what you say. We have to write a computer program and upload it to micro:bit what to do. A micro USB cable is used to transfer the code from PC to micro:bit

A micro:bit can only do what you tell it to do. You can use different programming languages to write program like [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/), which you can use to code in code blocks or JavaScript. You can also use Python to program a micro:bit.

On front face, it has 25 LEDs which we will use to display our game.

These are the main parts of a micro:bit.:point_down:

## Setup

Open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and click on :heavy_plus_sign:`New Project`.

![Setup]()

You should see something like this. 

![Project created]()

Once you finish setting up, let's get going:rocket:

## Code Blocks

Blocks are used to program easier without any specific syntax of programming. We can implement many concept of programming using code blocks. For example, we can implement, `conditionals` like `if`, `else-if` statements, `loops` like `do-while`, `for-then` etc.

These are some of the blocks we will use in this workshop.
